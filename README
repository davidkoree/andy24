Guide & Rules:
You can choose 2 digits every time and you must get an addictive 24 by mental arithmetic.
A 10 can be zero by double-click, and so does zero in opposite.
Not all 4 digits makes a 24, if not, you can double-click on the right blank to restart.
When you really got a 24, you could click on it to start next one. Otherwise, double-click :)
